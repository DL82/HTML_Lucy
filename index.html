        <h2>I'm Daniel, welcome to my website!</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-row-padding">
        <p>When COVID-19 started and me losing my job shortly after, my wife and I decided to go though with something we postponed for too long - adopting a dog.<br>
        Being at home meant going through an adoption process rather conveniently.</p>
        <p>On the 17th of April, a day before my birthday, Lucy joined the family.</p>

        <h2>Why "Lucy"?</h2>
        <p>The original name Lucy came with, did not work for us.<br>
            We started to throw names to the table, focusing on musicians we like and pretty soon reached the beatles and their song "Lucy in the sky".</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-row-padding" id="friend"><h2>Being the yougest "sister" in the mafily</h2>
            <p>Our two boys simply love Lucy, play with her as much as possible and fool around with her as if she'd been with us from day one. It was love at first sight.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-row-padding" id="fun"><h2>20KG puppy</h2>
            <p>Lucy is 1.5 years old and considered a medium size dog, but she has the behavior of a much younger and smaller puppy.<br> 
                She will jump on every human that walks by looking for effection, she is crazy over Tennis balls, she plays football (soccer) with us in the back yard and loves to run back and forth throwing her toys around. She demands we pet her constantly, to the point of knocking coffee mugs from the table because we sit in the living room and she must squeeze between the sofa and the table to reach us.<br> 
                Her "Good Morning" usually means coming to my side of the bed and waking me up with her nose. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-row-padding" id="diet"><h2>Sticks are not food!</h2>
            <p>Some dogs eat socks and underwear so Lucy is not that bad considering.<br> 
                She does however love to chew sticks of various shapes and sizes, to the point I had to hide my gardening tools, because any wooden handle might find itself chewed on the floor. Other than that, Lucy eats right and we try to keep her on a good diet, eating only her premium dog food and snacks, with occasion apple slices or choped cucumber as healthy treats.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-row-padding" id="guard"><h2>Being a guard dog is a 24/7 job</h2>
            <p>One thing we noticed right from the start that hasn't changes to this day, is Lucy's alertness when it comes to our yard. She barks at anything and anyone that goes by from the other end, causing kids and sometimes grown people to jump in place. Reading more about that, it appears she is protecting us and therefor find it hard to stop, even if we are with her in the yard playing or sitting around. 
            Although it might be a bit too much at times (to the point nagbhours might ask us to take her in), I kind of like it as it's one of those things that show her personality and commitment to us, ultimately making Lucy our dog.

        <div class="w3-row-padding">
        <p>Another special character of Lucy, she has anxiety issues.</p>
        <a2>Here is a list of a few things Lucy is affraid of:</a2>
        <ol>
            <li>The vacuum cleaner</li>
            <li>A regular broom</li>
            <li>Garbage bags</li>
            <li>The garden hose</li>
            <li>Drain openings</li>
            <li>Her own shadow (Seriously, she jumps when taken out for a walk at night, happened more than once...)</li>
        </ol>
